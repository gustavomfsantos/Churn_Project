# Churn Exploratory Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to explore and analyze churn data to understand the distribution between variables, between classes, and within the classes. It also includes correlation and pair plot analysis, as well as feature importance assessment using logistic regression and random forest models. The project utilizes undersampling techniques to balance the classes and predict churn using a logistic regression model.

## Project Structure
The project consists of a single Python file containing all functions:

churn_analysis.py: Python script containing functions for data exploration, correlation analysis, feature importance assessment, and undersampling techniques.

## Setup and Dependencies
To run the functions in churn_analysis.py, you'll need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn


## Results
The functions provided in churn_analysis.py enable users to perform various analyses, including data exploration, correlation analysis, feature importance assessment, and undersampling techniques. By leveraging these functions, users can gain insights into churn data and develop predictive models for churn prediction.

## Future Work
Enhance the functionality of existing functions and add new functions to support additional analyses.
Optimize the performance of machine learning models for churn prediction.
Develop a user-friendly interface or dashboard for easy access to analysis tools and results.
Complement this ReadME files with more robust content and images
